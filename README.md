### 👋👋👋 Hello! 👋👋👋

***

Nice seeing you 🫵 here! So nice you chose to stop by. 👍

I am Brian Schau. This is my spot on Github. I used do a lot of code but my career have turned more into the leading side of a development shop.

I currently work 💻 for [twoday](https://twoday.com/) in Denmark as a Product Owner / Engineering Lead with focus on the [Addo Sign](https://addosign.com/) digital signing ✍️ product.

I don't get that much time to code - but I do play around with the Ethereum blockchain 🔗, Javascript 🇯, Python 🐍 and Go lang 💚.
Look into my [Portfolio](https://github.com/bschau/Portfolio). The Portfolio contains all what I have done through the years - from the good ol' C64 days, thru Amiga, PalmOS, Android, iOS, Pebble, KaiOS, Microbit to Cloud based technologies. In all sorts of programming languages such as C, C#, Go, Java and Python.
