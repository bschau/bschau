### 👋👋👋 Hello! 👋👋👋

***

Nice seeing you 🫵 here! So nice you chose to stop by. 👍

However, I have moved all my stuff to [git.ldx.dk](https://git.ldx.dk/bs) - a selfhosted git instance ([Forgejo](https://forgejo.org)).

Why? Well, mainly because of the instable political climate in the United States. But lately, my faith in US led Big Tech has gone south.

Bye Github, it was nice knowing you.
