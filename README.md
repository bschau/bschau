### Hello!

***

I am Brian Schau. This is my spot on Github. I used do a lot of code but my career have turned more into the leading side of a development shop.

I currently work for [twoday](https://twoday.com/) in Denmark with focus on the [Addo Sign](https://addosign.com/) product.

I don't get that much time to code - but I do play around with the Ethereum blockchain, Javascript, Python and Go lang.
