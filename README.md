### 👋👋👋 Hello! 👋👋👋

***

Nice seeing you 🫵 here! So nice you chose to stop by. 👍

However, I have moved all my stuff to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/lorentzus).

Why? Well, mainly because of the unstable political climate in the United States. Lately, my faith in US led Big Tech has gone south. Using non-American tech and services has its virtues.

Bye Github, it was nice knowing you.
